The problem: given a list of numbers, find the two that sum to 2020, then multiply those two numbers together.

Input: A list of integers (max 4 digits each)
Output: The multiplication of the 2 integers that sum to 2020

Note: Only two numbers sum up to 2020
Note: Input is not sorted
Note: Input is only positive numbers


Possible approach (naive):
- Check every possible combination of two numbers in the input.
- Cost O(n^2)
Pseudocode:
Pick the first number of the list
Iterate on every other number
   If: you spot the sum, you stop
   Else:
    pick the second number of the list
    and restart

Worst case scenario: our two numbers are placed in position n, n-1.

Better solution:
- We sort our list (nlog(n))
- We take the first and last number of the list (nf,nl)
- Check if nf+nl == sum (if yes, return)
- If not:
  Check if nf+nl > sum: take nl-1 and repeat
  Else:
    take nf+1 and repeat

  Scenarios:
  1,1,1,1,1,1,......,2,2018 O(n)
  1,2019,9999,9999,9999,9999,......,9999,9999 O(n)
  1,1.....,1010,1010,......9999 O(n/2+n/2)=O(n)

  Cost O(n)
  Total cost O(nlog(n)+n) = O(nlog(n))

Solution: 969024

Part 2

Find three numbers that sum up to 2020.
- We sort our list
- We pick the first and last item nf, nl
- Iterate all the numbers from nf to nl, call it nm:
  
  if nf+nm+nl == sum: return nf * nm * nl
  
  After iteration:
  if nf+nl > sum: take nl-1 
  ...
  like before
