# Two Tomatoes: Learning Elixir (day6) || Phoenix data pipelines and observability

## Today's plan
Do chapter 6 of the [Real-Time Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/titles/sbsockets/real-time-phoenix/).

## Things done today
* Add statsd to some sockets and channels (the javascript connection didn't work, for unknown reasons)
* Write tests for data pipeline and stub some implementation (tests are still failing)

## Links
* Code examples: [rt-phoenix repo](https://github.com/lerrigatto/rt-phoenix)
