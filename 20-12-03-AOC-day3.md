Input: a list of lines, each line has `.` and `#`
Output: Number of `#` hit by our traverse from first char to last row
The traverse pattern is fixed to 3 right, 1 down the "map" repeats horizontally

Possible solution:

m = length of line

Until we have rows to traverse
  move to next position (3r, 1d)
  if next position is more than m
    move to next_position % m
  if there is a tree, we count it

Cost: O(n)

Part two, multiple slopes:

Cost: O(number_of_slopes * n) = O(n)
